Outline: 
The primary goal for our website is to help promote a small business that offers mattress production equipment.

Our audience consist of only potential clients who are commercial companies that produce mattress. The message of our site will be directed towards owners of these mattress producing companies. Other factors such as age, social-economics or geography doesn’t impact our target audience.
Most of the sales are from returning customers, so our goal was clear. We needed to build an easy to use website while making it much more attractive, so that existing customers won’t have any issues when they inquire about making a new order and so that new customer will be impressed by the level of professionalism that’s presented in our website. We included a testimonial section to help the customers feel like they are making the right decision by reading the comments that others left on the product.
We tried to make the website as expandable as possible although because of the time constraints we had to cut a couple of features short. You aren’t able to select which products you’d like the customers to see in the drop down menu, add products still hasn’t been fully developed, and when editing the customers is only possible with the username and password.
Another issue we ran into was formatting for the content. We came up with a crafty way of adding images and other HTML elements threw our database but this isn’t an acceptable method, it is currently setup in a way where you must edit product_detail.php every time you wish to insert a html element. Our plan was to make an edit content page but we didn’t get around to doing so. 
The instructions for our website:
